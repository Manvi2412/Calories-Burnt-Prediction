# Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the number of calories burnt based on exercise and physiological data using regression models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web app.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing features like age, gender, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature, the goal is to build a regression model that can predict the number of calories burnt during exercise.
