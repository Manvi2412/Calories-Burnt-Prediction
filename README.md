# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activity based on personal and exercise-related inputs.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built a regression model to estimate calories burned using features such as age, gender, height, weight, and duration of exercise.
- Applied data preprocessing, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the dataset.
- Evaluated and compared the performance of multiple regression models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ⚙️ Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge & Lasso Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Model evaluation using R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Strong positive correlation between duration and calories burned.  
- Gender and weight also significantly affect calorie output.  
- Random Forest showed the highest prediction accuracy.
